# Ghost Theme Without Styling
Example ghost theme I built while learning the structure of a theme from YT university.
There are four main files in this theme:

- index.hbs - the file that shows the list of your blog posts and serves as the main page of your blog.
- post.hbs - the file that renders your post content.
- package.json - the file that contains the important bits about your theme like metadata and some other configs.
- default.hbs - a container for all the HTML code generated when accessing a page on the blog.

## Partials folder
The partials folder in this repo includes a header.hbs file that includes the header info from ghost's Casper theme.

There's still a lot to learn about Ghost themes and also CSS. But I'll share artifacts of my learning here as I go :)

Have any questions? Let me know by either tweeting at me or commenting!

Here's an example screenshot from how it looks with Ghost's sample posts:
